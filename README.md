# Zephyr-II Parallelized

## Introduction :
This is a GUI-based Parallel program developed completely in C++ with the use of OpenMP parallel directives. It follows the methods present in the book ***Numerical Anaylysis 9th Edition (Richard L.Burden and J.douglas Faire)*** in order to numerically approximate roots, integrals , derivatives and differential equations which is far more efficient than anaylytically solving for answers. 

## Salient Features :
1. GUI based design using QT Framework inorder to streamline the UX for everytype of user.
2. GUI controls streamlined and well labelled in order to smooth user experience and avoid confusion.
3. Methods such as interpolation, differentiation and integration as well as differential eqauations allow for manual points input and function input with starting points as well,catering for both type of scenarios
4. Interpolation Tables implemented using QT's table widget to allow for a more comprehensive experience and one stop solution.
5. Differential Equation Tables also implemented using QT's table widget to show every approximated particular solution.
6. Values used for Open Newton Coates and Closed Newton Coates also displayed using the table Widget 
7. Parallel Methodology used to hasten the process of calculating various roots. 
8. OpenMP directives used in conjunction with thread safe data structures to maintain safe and stable code. 


## Frameworks and Libraries used:

1. C++ Language
2. QT Framework
